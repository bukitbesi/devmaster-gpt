  <h1>Privacy Policy – DevMaster 4.1 GPT</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 2025</p>

  <p>DevMaster 4.1 GPT does not collect, store, or share any personal data. All code processing occurs in real time through a secure connection with the DevMaster API hosted on Render.</p>

  <p>API access requires a Bearer token, which is never logged or saved. Your code is processed in-memory and not persisted. The tool uses OpenAI’s GPT platform and does not interact with any third-party services beyond Render-hosted APIs.</p>

  <p>DevMaster is built purely for educational and developer assistance purposes.</p>

  <p>If you have any questions or concerns, please contact: <strong>@bukitbesi on github.com</strong></p>
